# Biomedical Projects

## Overview

This repository contains two distinct biomedical projects focused on medical data analysis.

### Python Project

**Description:**
This machine learning project is designed to detect malaria in red blood cell images. Trained on a dataset of 27,558 images, the model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.

**Dataset Source:**
The dataset is sourced from the official NIH website [NIH Malaria Dataset](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/).

### SQL Project

**Description:**
This SQL project analyzes a simulated medical records dataset found on Kaggle that was generated using the Python Faker library. The dataset includes patient information, and queries are provided for various analyses.

**Dataset Source:**
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. License information for the dataset is marked as "unknown" on Kaggle.
You can directly download it from the SQL folder or from [Kaggle Medical Records](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cankatsrc/medical-records-dataset?resource=download) 

### Excel Project

**Description:** This project involves the analysis of a synthetic clinical trial dataset generated using Python's Faker library. The dataset includes information about patients participating in clinical trials, such as trial phase, outcomes, side effects, participant age, and gender.

**Dataset Source:** The dataset was generated using Python. Both the script and the generated CSV are available for download in the Excel repository.


**Notes:**
- These projects are for educational and illustrative purposes.
- Dataset sources are credited in each project.
